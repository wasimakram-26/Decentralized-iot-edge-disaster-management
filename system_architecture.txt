System Architecture:

Sensors (Temperature / Humidity)
        |
        v
Microcontroller (Edge Node)
        |
 Local Data Processing
        |
 Alert Generation (Buzzer / LED)

The system follows a decentralized architecture where each node
processes data independently without relying on a central server.
