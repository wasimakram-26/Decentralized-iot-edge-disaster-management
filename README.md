# Decentralized IoT Edge Disaster Management System

## Description
A decentralized IoT-based disaster monitoring system designed to detect
environmental conditions and process sensor data locally at the edge.
The system reduces latency and improves response time by avoiding
dependency on centralized cloud servers.

## Key Features
- Real-time environmental monitoring
- Edge-level data processing and decision making
- Decentralized system architecture
- Immediate alert generation during abnormal conditions

## Technologies Used
- IoT Sensors
- Microcontroller (Arduino)
- Embedded C / Arduino Programming
- Edge Computing Concepts

## System Workflow
1. Sensors continuously collect environmental data.
2. Data is processed locally at the edge node.
3. If threshold values are exceeded, alerts are generated instantly.
4. No dependency on cloud or internet connectivity.

## Outcome
The system demonstrated faster response by processing sensor data locally,
making it suitable for disaster-prone environments with limited connectivity.
